# GAN: Generating Handwritten Digits using Adversarial Networks

This code implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate handwritten digit images similar to the MNIST dataset. GANs are a type of deep learning model composed of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained in an adversarial manner.

## What are GANs?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of machine learning models that can learn to generate new data instances from a given dataset. They consist of two main components:

1. **Generator**: A neural network that learns to generate new, synthetic data instances that resemble the training data.
2. **Discriminator**: A neural network that learns to distinguish between real data instances from the training dataset and the synthetic data instances generated by the generator.

The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in an adversarial game. The generator tries to generate data that can fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify data as real or generated. This adversarial training process drives both the generator and discriminator to improve their performance iteratively.

## Python Code Details

### Generator

The generator is a convolutional neural network that takes a random noise vector as input and generates a 28x28 grayscale image resembling a handwritten digit. The architecture consists of:

- A dense layer that maps the input noise to a 7x7x256 tensor
- Upsampling layers using transposed convolutions to gradually increase the spatial dimensions and decrease the channel depth
- Batch normalization and LeakyReLU activations

### Discriminator

The discriminator is a convolutional neural network that takes a 28x28 grayscale image as input and classifies it as either real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the generator). The architecture consists of:

- Convolutional layers with strides to downsample the input image
- Leaky ReLU activations and dropout for regularization
- A dense output layer with a single node to predict the probability of the input being real or fake

### Training Loop

The training loop implements the adversarial training process:

1. Generate a batch of random noise vectors and use the generator to produce a batch of fake images.
2. Compute the discriminator's loss for classifying real MNIST images and the fake generated images.
3. Compute the generator's loss based on the discriminator's ability to classify the generated images as fake.
4. Update the discriminator's weights using the discriminator's loss.
5. Update the generator's weights using the generator's loss.

This process is repeated for a specified number of epochs, and generated images are saved every 10 epochs to visualize the generator's progress.

## Note

Implementation: To run the code, simply execute the Python script. The MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded and used for training. The generated images will be saved as PNG files every 10 epochs, and the training progress will be printed to the console.

Important: This implementation assumes the availability of a GPU for efficient training. If no GPU is available, the code will fallback to CPU training, which may be significantly slower.
